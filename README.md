# Bank-Marketing-Analysis

A marketing campaign is a long-term strategy for promoting a product or service across several
media. It typically serves only one objective, which is to increase the sales of a given product. A
Term Deposit is a deposit that a bank or financial institution offers with a fixed rate (often better
than just opening a deposit account in which your money will be returned back at a specific
maturity time. How can the financial institution improve the efficacy of future marketing
campaigns? A good analysis of the last marketing campaign performed would help us identify
the patterns and find conclusions to develop future strategies.

We used all of our suggested methodologies on the Bank Marketing Analysis dataset, focusing
on the Term deposit by classifying it as Yes or No. We balanced the target column by random
sampling, separated the data into train and test, then utilized that data to train the model and
assess the accuracy with test data. Random sampling is performed solely on train data, while test
data is set away for subsequent testing.
